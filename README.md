## Installation
Using npm:

$ yarn add setprotocol.js
```

In Node.js:

// Like with web3, instantiate a new instance and pass in the provider
const setProtocolInstance = new SetProtocol(currentProvider);

For now, you will have to look at the source code itself for documentation, but we will be working to provide a rich set of documentation for this.
